# Servo-Sine-Demo
Theoretically controls a servo by sine wave, stays between 0 and 255 at all times.

This is not meant to be made for python specifically. I wanted a pure-math solution I could use without any if/else statements. That's why the code is very confusing and hard to read. This is more of a thing for me to have some working "formulas" to get sine waves to behave this way.
